<!-- Pig Latin rules:
- for words that begin with "qu", move "qu" to the end and add "ay" i.e. "quick" becomes "ickquay"
- for words that begins with vowels [a, e, i, o, u], add "way" to the end i.e. "away" becomes "awayway"
- for words beginning with consonants (any other letter(s)), move all consecutive consonants to the end
    and add "ay" i.e. "code" becomes "odecay"
